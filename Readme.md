# Roboter

Roboter is an autoclicker (and autokeypresser) for both linux, windows and mac (hotkeys on mac are untested). When I searched for one for Linux, I only found a single graphical one that had what I wanted. So I decided to make my own.

Word of warning: It is only on github because it was requested, I don't really use github. I might fail to see pull requests/issues or be slow to react to them, sorry for that.

## Requirements

Java version 8 or newer.
For Hotkeys to work, check the requirements of the used library jnativehook over at [its own github]([https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook))

## Builds

You can find a build on the [main website](https://double-helix.industries/applications/roboter/)
